Thin_Vessel_Segmentation
========================
This is my master project about segmentation on 3D thin vessels. The project was build with Visual Studio 2010 with 64-bit Windows 7. 


Dependencies
========================
In order to run the project, you will have the install the following softwares, 

 - OpenCV
 - Matlab
 - OpenGL
  
Some important dlls have been inlcuded in the project under VesselNess/depencencies. Run the SET_PATH.bat to add the dlls to your Environment PATH. After that, you will be able run most parts of the project other than anything related with MIP (Maximum Intensity Projection). 

Data
========================
The data we have been working with are 3D volumns and they are hugh. I don't want to commit them to github. Feel free to email me for the data if you want (yzhong.cs@gmail.com).
