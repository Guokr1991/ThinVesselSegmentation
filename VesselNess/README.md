Vesselness Measure/Filter
========================

This is a cpp implementation of Vesselness Measure for 3D volume based on the following paper. 

- Frangi, Alejandro F., et al. "Multiscale vessel enhancement filtering." Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Interventation—MICCAI’98. Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 1998. 130-137.

Two sample code is provided in main.cpp
- computing vesselness measure
- extracting the vessel centrelines with non-maximum suppression
